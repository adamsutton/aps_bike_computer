# Aps_Bike_Compter (ABC)

Introduction
------------

An attempt to build a simple bike computer using various readily available
components.

Initially it's just about producing some software that can run on a simple
ARM Cortex MCU and talk to the relevant peripherals.

Later I'll look into possibly a simple custom PCB to integrate things into a
usable package. And maybe even some sort of casework.
